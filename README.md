Currently only working for windows, this is my first attempt to create a finished project in python, so if you discover any issues besides the ones already mentioned or perhaps an oversight in the way I have constructed my code, please feel free to make any advancing changes.

### Issues found so far:
- Minor issue catching temp files when processing downloads
